Assignment: Developing a RESTful API

In this assignment, you will create a RESTful API following industry standards and best practices. Here are the key requirements:

Compliance with REST Standards: Your API should adhere to RESTful principles, utilizing the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH HTTP methods as appropriate.

HTTP Status Codes: Ensure that your API returns HTTP status codes according to industry standards. Proper error handling should be implemented for 500, 400, 404, 200, and 201 status codes.

Model Validation: Implement mandatory field validation within your models to ensure data integrity.

Routing: Utilize routing mechanisms effectively to map HTTP requests to the appropriate controller actions.

Model Binding: Demonstrate model binding capabilities by showcasing examples of binding from both the request body and query parameters.

Bonus Challenge: Go beyond the standard CRUD operations by adding additional functionalities such as listing and sorting. For example, consider implementing endpoints like /api/products/list?name=abc to demonstrate advanced API features.

By completing this assignment, you will gain practical experience in building a well-structured and standards-compliant RESTful API using .NET. To get started, make sure you have the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package installed and set up in Visual Studio 2022.
